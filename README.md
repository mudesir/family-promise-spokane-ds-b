# Getting Started

### User Flows

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/FyWvcZzY/family-promise-of-spokane)

Our team is developing a digital intake form for families in Family Promise Shelter. This intake form is a replacement for the paper form currently being filled by guests of the shelter. All the Data is given by the guests. We have a multi-class random forest model that takes the guest data and predicts their exit destination. The possible Exit Destination are as follow. 
- Permanent Exit
- Temporary Exit
- Emergency Shelter
- Transitional Housing
- Unknown/Other

### Key Features

- Supervisors can Create guest profile 
- Case Manager can view guest profile 
- Case Manager can view the exit destination prediction
- Guest can be flagged for mis conduct
- notes can be added to guest's profile. 
- Guest can view their own profile. 
### Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  DB_URL  - Postgres database credentials



### Content Licenses

### Installation Instructions

We used Docker for ease of use when dealing with environmental dependancies 

#### Scripts

    Get AWS credentials
    
    Get your AWS access keys
    
    Install AWS Command Line Interface
    
    * aws configure -> configures AWS CLI
    * pip install pipx -> installs pipx
    * pipx install awsebcli -> installs AWS Elastic BeanStalk CLI
[Follow AWS EB docs](https://docs.labs.lambdaschool.com/data-science/tech/aws-elastic-beanstalk)
    
    Then use the EB CLI:
    
    * git add --all 
    * git commit -m "Your commit message" 
    * eb init -p docker YOUR-APP-NAME --region us-east-1 
    * eb create YOUR-APP-NAME 
    * eb open 
    
    Then use AWS Route 53 to set up a domain name with HTTPS for your DS API
    
    Redeploy:
    
    * git commit ... 
    * docker build ... 
    * docker push ... 
    * eb deploy 
    * eb open 

# Tech Stack

### Data Science API built using:

- Python
- Docker
- FastAPI
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- PostgreSQL
- Pipenv

### Why we made our tech stack decisions:

- Wanted to gain insight to AWS
- Docker and Pipenv makes environments easier
- FastAPI has been gaining traction over Flask
- SQL queries are better structured 

### Libraries used:
- FastAPI
- sci-kit-learn
- Pandas
- psycopg2

# User Flow

### Data Science API

We are receiving a POST request with the member id from the web team and using that id to query the database, choose the features used to create the classification model, predict the exit destination and returning a prediction for the exit destination along with the top features in JSON format. 

# Architecture Chart
![Architecture](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/family-promise-spokane-ds-a/raw/main/architecture_diagram2.png)




# End Points
/predict: send POST request to this endpoint with the member_id value. 

# Issues
* Newest Model not implemented Due to the following issues. 
*  Some Features needed for the new predictive model is not on the back-end Database
* Some Features on the new Predictive Model differs in data format and data type from the back-end database.
